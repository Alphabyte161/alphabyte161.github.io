Hello, I am Grace Cohen, a student at UC Davis pursuing a double major in Atmospheric Science and Japanese. I am an active researcher in the field of Tornadoes, Severe Weather, and Climatology; also specializing in microscale to mesoscale numerical modeling. This site will have all my stuff (socials, photos, research, T.R.E.P., etc.) so feel free to look around!

Outside of the lab you will usually find me storm chasing, gaming, or doing photography. :P
